This project (for now) consisted of the browser plugin and a web server.

# Project structure (WIP)
- `__chupmu`: deprecated development folder. However, its code is still relevant and therefore is kept for now.
- `dbpage`: holds code for the website where we will host the market place for DBs.
- `extension`: Firefox extension code
